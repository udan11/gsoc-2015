title: Week 2
---

Today is the last day of the second week of Google Summer of Code. My task for this week was to continue working on the parser and the analyzer. Since last week, I got to rewrite a few parts of the library that required improvements, wrote unit tests that account for more than 90% of the code, wrote more explicit documentation, made sure that my code follows the PSR-2 standard, implemented new statement types (`CREATE FUNCTION`, `RENAME`, `REPLACE`, etc).

For the next two weeks, I planned to make use of the library I wrote during the past weeks in phpMyAdmin and refactor the code that uses it.

If you want to check out the code I wrote during the past weeks, you can find it in its repository [here](https://github.com/udan11/sql-parser).

_NOTE_: The last commit is still _"Initial commit"_ because I amended my last commit and did a force push.
