title: Week 12
---

This week, most of my work was done on sql-parser. I fixed a couple of bugs, wrote tests for the new features introduced over the last weeks, updated documentation (wiki as well) and moved the tools for tests and contexts generation to the sql-parser repository.

Next week is the last week week of Google Summer of Code and I will focus on fixing bugs and miscellaneous improvements (documentation and refactoring mostly).

To see my progress, you can check out [my library repository](https://github.com/udan11/sql-parser) or some of the [pull requests](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=author%3Audan11) I submitted this week.
