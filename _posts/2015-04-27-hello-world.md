Hello, world!

I am one of the participants in this year's Google Summer of Code. During this summer, I will be working with the phpMyAdmin team to rewrite the SQL parser that is used in analyzing queries. My project's title is "Parser and Analyzer Rewrite" and as the name suggests, the purpose of it is to rewrite a better SQL parser and analyzer that will be implemented in phpMyAdmin by the end of the summer. During this summer, Marc Delisle, who is one of the maintainers of phpMyAdmin and my mentor, is going to review my work.

To get a better idea of what my project consists, you can read the abstract of my proposal that can be found on Google Melange website [here]({{ site.abstract }}) and a copy of my entire proposal, which can be found [here]({{ site.proposal }}). I hope it will serve well any students that are planning to participate in GSoC next years.
