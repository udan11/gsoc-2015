title: Week 6
---

During this week I continued replacing code that was related to the old parsing library. The new library suffered a lot of changes too. Some of the most important are: implemented a builder, improved lots of statements, the library takes into consideration the SQL mode in some operations, lots of fixes, improved the documentation and the code coverage is now over 98%.

One of the most important tasks accomplished this week is that I finished refactoring `sql.lib.php`, `DisplayResults.class.php`, `Table.class.php` and a huge part of the code related to export.

I hope that the next week I will finish refactoring the old code and fix as many bugs as possible.

To see my progress, you can check out [my library repository](https://github.com/udan11/sql-parser) or the pull request I submit for [phpMyAdmin](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/pull/1728).
