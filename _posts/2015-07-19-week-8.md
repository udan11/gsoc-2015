title: Week 8

During the past week I worked on the linter and in order to provide better analysis I had to improve the library by creating new rules that check for errors.

At this moment, any code that is written in the SQL query box or in the console goes through the library which analyzes it and provides feedback. I hope that this feature will help many users spot their errors even before executing their queries and improve their work flow. Some of the errors are pretty difficult to detect and the overhead involved isn't worth it, which means that not all errors are detected by the library. I tried to focus on syntax as much as possible.

During the next week, I will try improve the localization of the library, make error strings translatable and increase the overall code coverage. I am not sure to which extent I will be increase the code coverage, but I hope that I will be able to increase it by at least a few percents.

To see my progress, you can check out [my library repository](https://github.com/udan11/sql-parser) or some of the pull requests ([#1788](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/pull/1788) & [#1799](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/pull/1799)) I submit this week.
