title: Week 7

During the past week I finished replacing the old parser. The remaining part of the code that required replacing was small, so I had enough time to also test it and so far it works fine.

There were fragments of code that relied on regular expressions for analysis and some of those were replaced during the process, but I believe that some of the remaining regular expressions won't be replaced, because they perform good and faster than the parser would.

Most of the bugs I were aware of and tested with the new parser seem to be fixed. For the next week I planned on fixing the remaining bugs and implementing new features regarding the parser. I will improve the parsers to provide better, strict error messages so I can built the linter on top of it.

To see my progress, you can check out [my library repository](https://github.com/udan11/sql-parser) or the pull request I submit for [phpMyAdmin](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/pull/1728) and was merged today.
