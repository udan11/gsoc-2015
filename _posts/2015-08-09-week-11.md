title: Week 11

This week I found and fixed a a couple of bugs and rewrote an important part of the import mechanism of phpMyAdmin.

One of the most challenging tasks of this week was probably implementing the new import mechanism. The fact that it has to process so much data made performance a top priority.

At first, I tried using the standard lexer to delimit statements, but I failed. For huge queries (that are also buffered) parsing the query over and over again to check if a statement finished was too slow. I decided to write a specialized parser (`BufferedQuery`) that tries to parse only the most important parts of the query (comments, strings and delimiters) in order to be able to split the statements and execute them separately. At this moment is performs well and also fixes bug [#11339](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues/11339) which was reopened due to some edge case not being handled correctly.

For the next week, I planned on finishing the query builder and write tests.

To see my progress, you can check out [my library repository](https://github.com/udan11/sql-parser) or some of the [pull requests](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=author%3Audan11) I submitted this week.
